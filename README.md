Achieving around 90% accuracy after 20 epochs.
Test set was generated manually by myself.

Data set is available for download at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765&WT.mc_id=rss_alldownloads_devresources

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Some of the .jpeg files in the dataset receive corruption error while being resized using OpenCV. That is why the resulting train set size is smaller than the actual training set.
